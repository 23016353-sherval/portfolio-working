                <h2>~~INTRODUCTION~~</h2>
                <h4>
                    This project was a side project I made at the start of January this year. Animation is just a hobby of 
                    mine that I do in my free time and this is one of my best videos gaining over 900 views in 2 weeks. 
                    But this is of course just a side hobby but I want to showcase it because I believe it showcases my 
                    creativity as well as my problem solving skills.

                <h3>STORY</h3>
                <h4>
                    The original story is called Skating Hallucination. The storyline goes, The skater is performing on ice with a violin.
                    While immersed in their music, a stage light breaks loose and falls on them, whether by coincidence or foul play is up 
                    to the viewer to decide, unless shown otherwise. The skater's partner is in the audience and can only helplessly watch 
                    as the events unfold, the skater eventually dies and their partner goes to the ice rink and skates around a bit to clear 
                    their mind. While they are skating on the rink the hallucination of the skater starts appearing. On the beat drop, when 
                    the partner looks up, they will see the skater skating along with them, giving them a reassuring smile that everything will be ok.

                <p class="spacer" style="margin: 3rem;"></p>
                <h3>INSPIRATION</h3>
                <h4>
                    When I started watching these gacha animations again this story was the one that was currently trending,
                    I was looking through a lot of different people's versions of this story and I was inspired by 
                    3 versions of it which led me to realise the potential animation had to tell stories and move people. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The first version that inspired me was the very first version of this story that I watched, which was what 
                    led to me wanting to make my own version of this story. It was about 2 friends instead of partners, the story is roughly 
                    the same but after the skater dies, their friend takes up violin and starts practicing, and attends the skating competition
                    in memory of the skater. While performing she get flashbacks and starts to tear up and but she's happy, the friend is smiling 
                    while tearing up while the skater is giving a happy smile, seeing that the friend is ok and disappears.
                    <br/>
                    This version inspired me because it shows Resilience in the Face of Adversity. Despite the skater’s tragic death, 
                    the friend shows resilience by continuing to skate and perform showing that even in the face of unimaginable challenges, 
                    we can find the strength to continue moving forward, whether for the memory of someone we loved or for our own personal growth.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The second version was about partners again, but after the light fell on the skater, the partner rushed over, 
                    holding the skater in their arms while shouting at people to hurry up and help her, the look of desperation all over his face.
                    She doesn't make it and it was revealed that they had a little child, barely a few months old. Few years later, when she's all grown up,
                    her dad brought her to the rink and she ventures off on her own for a bit, which is when the hallucination of the skater, the mother, 
                    starts flickering and she appears next to her daugther with a smile and tears rolling down her face.
                    Happy to see that her daughter is growing up well.
                    <br/>
                    The story telling of this second animation shows me that animations can be more than just pictures on a screen but can tell beautiful stories that move people.
                    And this version shows that Love transcends death. Even if the skater’s death leaves a void, the love between the three of them continues to resonate. 
                    The mother’s hallucination appearing to her daughter symbolizes that the love we have for someone doesn’t end with their passing but it continues to live on, shaping 
                    the lives of those who remain.

                <h3>CREATION</h3>
                <h4>
                    Story:
                    <br/>
                    Inspired by the above, I was compelled to combine all the amazing qualities I saw together.
                    In my version of this story, it tells a tale of 2 twins performing together, 1 dancer, 1 violinist.
                    As the performance starts, the dancer goes on ahead to dance but when he looks back he sees the stage light falling, 
                    but he's too far and its too fast for him to be able to do anything, the violinist gets struck by the light and he 
                    stops and rushes back to help her while desperately trying to get help. She did survive and is stable but is in a coma, 
                    and he can't help but feel bad because he was at that excat spot less than a few seconds ago.
                    He decides to join the next competition for the both of them since he doesn't know when she will wake up. 
                    On day of competition, it turns of that she had already woken up from the coma and had joined her brother 
                    in the competition without his knowledge. He remembered the trick they were trying to do and what he wanted to acheive from this competiton, 
                    and when he did a flip, he saw her and started tearing up as she skated up to join him and finish their performance.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The message for this story of mine is that 'Life is Unpredictable, But Hope is Essential'
                    <br/>
                    No matter how difficult life becomes, there are always opportunities for unexpected turns that bring positivity or solutions. 
                    It’s about trusting that things can change, even when the odds seem impossible.

                    The process was a bit difficult because of the app I used for this which was CuteCutPro, 
                    the animation mechanics were different from what other people use as they dont use keyframes 
                    for animating movement so you have to slowly set each move on its own, I tried to move each 
                    limb on its own but because there are no grouping or keyframe mechanics, the limbs are not 
                    connected to each other which makes it difficult to animate properly without something look 
                    very weird so i tried to move the characters around as a whole anywhere I can which makes 
                    it easier. Another problem with the app is that there are no effects to choose from, so you 
                    have to either make the effects yourself or not have any at all. I managed to make a kind of 
                    shake effect by zooming in a bit then moving the video from left to right in very short intervals.
                    I also managed to make the ghost pop effect at the end by duplicating the entire video and enlarging 
                    it while making the opacity become 0.

                <h4>This animation gave me the opportunity too think outside the box and find ways to work around problems that show up 
                    in the most unexpected places. Even though I had no idea how to make effects, I observed how the effects look and 
                    figured out ways to replicate it with my problem solving skills. I hope this animation can apeeal to the hearts of 
                    the viewers and for them to understand that Life is Unpredictable, But Hope is Essential. No matter how difficult 
                    life becomes, there are always opportunities for unexpected turns that bring positivity or solutions. It’s about
